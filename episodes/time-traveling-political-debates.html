      Step into the time vortex as we witness a clash of political ideologies from different eras. In this episode, a time-traveling mishap brings politicians from various historical periods into a debate on contemporary issues.

      Join us as we explore the absurdity of Victorian politicians grappling with social media regulations, ancient philosophers discussing climate change, and medieval monarchs debating the merits of universal healthcare.

      Will these time-traveling debates lead to a harmonious blending of ideas, or will the clash of historical perspectives create chaos in the present? Get ready for a journey through the ages in this time-bending political extravaganza!
